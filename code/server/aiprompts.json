[{"id":"nssLmBScWL","result":"The purpose of life is a deeply philosophical and personal question that each individual must ultimately answer for themselves. Some believe that the purpose of life is to seek happiness and fulfillment, while others believe it is to serve others and contribute to the greater good of humanity.
